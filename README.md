# DuoPingo

### Listen, rest of the text are ai generated
This project uses generative AI questions powered by your own API key. You only need to set it up once, and you can remove it anytime from the app. Everything runs fully on the client side - the only external call is to the Gemini API using your own key.

**Reimagining how developers learn and grow through open source.**

DuoPingo is an open-source React application built around a simple idea:  
learning software should be creative, intuitive, and technically sound at the same time.

This project explores a development philosophy I call **Vibecode** — where creativity drives the process, but clean architecture, refactoring, and best practices remain non-negotiable.

## The Journey: Antigravity → Vibecode

The first iteration of DuoPingo was built using **Google’s agentic IDE (Antigravity)**.  
While the tool accelerated parts of the workflow, every idea, feature, and direction came from my own vision.

I used the IDE as an assistant—not a decision-maker.

After the initial version, I **fully refactored the entire codebase by hand**, returning everything to:
- Standard developer practices  
- Clear project structure  
- Safe and maintainable code conventions  

This refinement process shaped what I now call **Vibecode**:
> A fluid, intuitive way of building software that preserves creativity without sacrificing technical discipline.

## Open Source at Heart

DuoPingo is **completely open source**.

This repository isn’t just about sharing code—it’s about sharing the **thinking, experimentation, and iteration** behind it.  
Anyone is welcome to:
- Explore the codebase  
- Learn from the structure and refactors  
- Contribute ideas or improvements  

Open collaboration matters more than perfection.
